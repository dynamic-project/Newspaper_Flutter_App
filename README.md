Welcome!

I've completed this project within very short time because I am busy for my patients and office. I've tried to complete this project in a organize way.
But because of short time I was unable to use my knowledge and skill properly. 

I've added functionalities for firebase login,sign up and sign out option.

I'm fetching data from API and showing those in list and tapping on a list item will forward you to details screen.

I've also added option for bookmarking specific topic. And I stored those information in sqflite database for further use. User will be able to add to
add to bookmark and remove from bookmark. All informations are maintained in the database. When user will click in the bookmarked button they will be able
to see their bookmarked list and by by clicking on a list they will be able to see the details.

I've used setState() mechanism for state management because of short time. I've able to use Riverpod, Bloc mechanism for state management.

Finally, in some stages I faced errors and because of short time I was unable to try to solve those errors and provide you screen shots of the running app
and because of errors I was unable to build apk to provide you.

But you can review my code and you'll find that my process is perfect according to your needs.

If you want I'll be able to provide you running app if I get time to solve those errors.

Thank you.
